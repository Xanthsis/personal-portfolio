# personal-portfolio
It is my personal Portfolio. I will update it every once a while ðŸ˜Š

So as the name tells it is my personal portfolio,
It has details of my Skills, Contact page so basically it's a mini resume but in website!
Hope you might find it nice btw it's not totally mine i made it help of a tutorial. It is my first proper project.

In this project I have used React JS and tailwindcss mainly.
A faced a very rookie mistake in this project i.e, at first i was having some difficulty using tailwind css with react
It was not working at all even though I installed all the dev  dependencies correctly (as far as I know).
I made half of the project but it still wasn't working so started it again from scratch this time I installed tailwind csss very carefullly and it wokred!
So this a very genuine problem I faced, I hope no one faces any problem (though it's impossible).

EXTRA FEAUTERS I WANNA ADD
In future I am looking forwards to adding a Login/Sign Up page, 
and adding blogs on a regular basis. I kind of wanna make it educational site where one can
increase there productivity and can gain knowledge. (BASICALLY STUDENT PRODUCTIVITY WEBSITE).
